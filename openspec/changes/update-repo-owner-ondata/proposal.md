# Change: Move repository ownership to ondata organization

## Why
The repository is moving from the personal account to the ondata organization. Documentation, badges, and published references must reflect the new canonical URL to avoid confusion and broken links.

## What Changes
- Update documentation and in-app links to the new repository URL under the ondata organization.
- Preserve npm package ownership and scope as @aborruso (no npm ownership change).
- Confirm GitHub Pages and related references align with the new organization ownership.

## Impact
- Affected specs: repository-metadata, cloudflare-deployment (docs references)
- Affected code: README.md, docs/*, src/worker.ts, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml
